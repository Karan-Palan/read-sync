# ReadSync

<summary>The Problem</summary>

I read a lot, primarily non-fiction books—each and every month. But this is the catch: I don't buy them very often.

What I do is search for them on Internet Archive or Libgen, download the EPUB copies, rename the titles to make them clear, and send them directly to my Kindle. That's my pipeline. Once a book's on my device, I read it, mark important passages, and take notes -> ideas I want to recall, insights I want to absorb.

Once I'm finished, I export those summaries and notes, typically in HTML or Markdown, from the Kindle mobile app. I then send them to myself through WhatsApp (yes, it's strangely convenient) or export them into Notion, where all my long-term plans reside.

Why do all this?

Because I think something simple but profound:
Humans need to be reminded more than they need to be taught.

A single read through a book isn't sufficient. I want those highlights and learnings to come back to me over and over again—until they're second nature. It's my personal feedback loop.

Having learned to code, I thought—why not create a product that encloses this entire process in one streamlined system? Something that's like Readwise (which I adore), but more aligned with the way I work.

This is not a project. It's a solution to a problem I live with every day.

This was the initial Idea:

First I will create a mern app with google and notion auth, save the downloaded epub/pdf files, and create a database for the app. Amazon has a closed ecosystem which is very sad. I will first create it as a standalone app, then add the "Sync" features.
